<h2 id="header">Description</h2>

    braided and twisted to make a nice muffin sized treat.</p>

<h3 id="header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup warm whole milk</li>
        <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, very soft</li>
    </ul>
<h4 id="header">Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine warm milk and dry active yeast in the bowl of your 
            stand mixer; let stand for 10 minutes. Add flour, eggs, sugar, 
            and salt. Use the dough hook to knead the mixture until the 
            flour almost disappears, about 1 minute. Add the soft room 
            temperature butter, and continue kneading the 
            dough until a very smooth ball of dough forms, 4 to 5 
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Set dough into a lightly buttered bowl, cover, and 
            let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 
            2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide in 2 pieces. Form each half 
            into a smooth ball and transfer each one into a plastic bag. 
            Refrigerate bags overnight for best results or the dough can 
            be used immediately. Each half of 
            the dough will make 4 brioche.</li>
        <li>When ready to make, roll and stretch dough into a 14 x 10 inch 
            rectangle. Spread 4 tablespoons of soft room temperature butter 
            over two thirds of the dough, stopping 1/2 inch from the 
            edge.</li>
        <li>Fold unbuttered third up over the top, and then the opposite
             end to complete the trifold. Gently press and seal the edges
              together. Fold in thirds again to form a square. Wrap and place in 
            the freezer until cold and 
            slightly firm, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough out into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick, or 
            thin enough to fold, and repeat the two folding in thirds 
            step. Wrap and place in the freezer again until cold and 
            slightly firm, 15 more minutes. A little bit of 
            water can be used to help the dough stick if needed.</li>
        <li>Roll dough out into a rectangle again, just like in the 
            previous step. Fold into thirds, but keep as a rectangle 
            (do not make the second fold). Wrap and place
             in the freezer until cold and 
             slightly firm, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Roll dough into a 12 x 16 inch rectangle and place 
            in the freezer until cold and 
            slightly firm, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Trim off about 1/8 inch of dough from the sides 
            and cut into 4 rectangles that are about 6 x 3 inches.</li>
        <li>Start with 1 piece (keeping the others in the fridge so they 
            stay cool) and make two cuts starting 1/2 inch from top, all 
            the way to the bottom to create 3 strips of dough. Braid 
            together, and seal at bottom. Flip over and add about 1 
            tablespoon of dark chocolate chunks along the center of the 
            braided dough, or more to taste. Roll up from the smaller end 
            to create a knot. Place 
            seam side down in buttered muffin tin.</li>
        <li>After all braids are done, cover, and let
             rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 
             about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Brush brioche with egg wash, and sprinkle very lightly with some coarse salt. 
            Then sprinkle very generously with the granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until nicely browned, about 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Let cool in the pan for about 5 minutes and
             then transfer onto a rack to cool completely before serving.</li>
