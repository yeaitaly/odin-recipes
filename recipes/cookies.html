    <h2>Description</h2>
         <p> These chocolate thumbprint cookies have a 
            ganache filling that bumps up the rich chocolate 
            flavor and adds a nice creaminess to the cookie.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup unalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>sanding sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of oven. 
                Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy, 
                about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating until 
                incorporated.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a medium
                bowl until combined. With mixer on low speed, gradually add 
                flour mixture to 
                butter mixture, beating until well combined, 
                about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls, then roll balls in sanding sugar. 
                Place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Press the center of each
                ball with your thumb (about 1/2-inch deep and 1/2-inch wide)
                .</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven in upper and lower thirds, 2 baking sheets at a time, rotating top to 
                bottom and bottom to top halfway through, 
                until cookies are set and almost firm, 8 to 10 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cool on baking sheets, about 15 minutes. When cool, press the center of each ball with your 
                thumb again—the indentations will have puffed in the 
                oven.</li>
            <li>Heat cream in a small microwavable bowl on HIGH until just steaming, about 45 seconds. 
                Remove from the heat, and add chopped chocolate. Let the mixture sit, undisturbed, for 2 minutes. 
                Stir until melted and smooth. Let cool until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Place about 1 teaspoon 
                filling in the center of each cookie. 
                Slide the cookies into the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to set the filling. The cookies will keep 
                for about 5 days in an airtight container at room 
                temperature.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup warm whole milk</li>
            <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>4 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, very soft</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine warm milk and dry active yeast in the bowl of your 
                stand mixer; let stand for 10 minutes. Add flour, eggs, sugar, 
                and salt. Use the dough hook to knead the mixture until the 
                flour almost disappears, about 1 minute. Add the soft room 
                temperature butter, and continue kneading the 
                dough until a very smooth ball of dough forms, 4 to 5 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Set dough into a lightly buttered bowl, cover, and 
                let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 
                2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Punch down the dough and divide in 2 pieces. Form each half 
                into a smooth ball and transfer each one into a plastic bag. 
                Refrigerate bags overnight for best results or the dough can 
                be used immediately. Each half of 
                the dough will make 4 brioche.</li>
            <li>When ready to make, roll and stretch dough into a 14 x 10 inch 
                rectangle. Spread 4 tablespoons of soft room temperature butter 
                over two thirds of the dough, stopping 1/2 inch from the 
                edge.</li>
            <li>Fold unbuttered third up over the top, and then the opposite
                 end to complete the trifold. Gently press and seal the edges
                  together. Fold in thirds again to form a square. Wrap and place in 
                the freezer until cold and 
                slightly firm, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough out into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick, or 
                thin enough to fold, and repeat the two folding in thirds 
                step. Wrap and place in the freezer again until cold and 
                slightly firm, 15 more minutes. A little bit of 
                water can be used to help the dough stick if needed.</li>
            <li>Roll dough out into a rectangle again, just like in the 
                previous step. Fold into thirds, but keep as a rectangle 
                (do not make the second fold). Wrap and place
                 in the freezer until cold and 
                 slightly firm, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll dough into a 12 x 16 inch rectangle and place 
                in the freezer until cold and 
                slightly firm, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Trim off about 1/8 inch of dough from the sides 
                and cut into 4 rectangles that are about 6 x 3 inches.</li>
            <li>Start with 1 piece (keeping the others in the fridge so they 
                stay cool) and make two cuts starting 1/2 inch from top, all 
                the way to the bottom to create 3 strips of dough. Braid 
                together, and seal at bottom. Flip over and add about 1 
                tablespoon of dark chocolate chunks along the center of the 
                braided dough, or more to taste. Roll up from the smaller end 
                to create a knot. Place 
                seam side down in buttered muffin tin.</li>
            <li>After all braids are done, cover, and let
                 rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, 
                 about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Brush brioche with egg wash, and sprinkle very lightly with some coarse salt. 
                Then sprinkle very generously with the granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven until nicely browned, about 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Let cool in the pan for about 5 minutes and
                 then transfer onto a rack to cool completely before serving.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
