    <h2>Description</h2>
         <p> These chocolate thumbprint cookies have a 
            ganache filling that bumps up the rich chocolate 
            flavor and adds a nice creaminess to the cookie.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup unalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>sanding sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of oven. 
                Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy, 
                about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating until 
                incorporated.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a medium
                bowl until combined. With mixer on low speed, gradually add 
                flour mixture to 
                butter mixture, beating until well combined, 
                about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls, then roll balls in sanding sugar. Place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Press the center of each
                ball with your thumb (about 1/2-inch deep and 1/2-inch wide)
                .</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven in upper and lower thirds, 2 baking sheets at a time, rotating top to bottom and bottom to top halfway through, 
                until cookies are set and almost firm, 8 to 10 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cool on baking sheets, about 15 minutes. When cool, press the center of each ball with your 
                thumb againâ€”the indentations will have puffed in the 
                oven.</li>
            <li>Heat cream in a small microwavable bowl on HIGH until just steaming, about 45 seconds. Remove from the heat, and add chopped chocolate. Let the mixture sit, undisturbed, for 2 minutes. Stir until melted and smooth. Let cool until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Place about 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each cookie. Slide the cookies into the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to set the filling. The cookies will keep 
                for about 5 days in an airtight container at room 
                temperature.</li>
        </ol>
